# Sensors-and-Actuators

UNIT I 	CLASSIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF SENSORS AND ACTUATORS 

Classification of Sensors and Actuators - General Requirements for Interfacing - Units and Measures - Transfer function - Impudence and matching - Range, Span, Resolution, Accuracy, Errors, Repeatability, Sensitivity and analysis - Hysteresis , Nonlinearity and saturation - Frequency response, response time and bandwidth - Calibration - Excitation - Deadband - Reliability. 


UNIT II 	TEMPERATURE SENSORS AND THERMAL ACTUATORS 	

Thermo resistive Sensors: Themistors, Resistance temperature sensors - Silicon resistive sensors - Thermoelectric Sensors - PN Junction Temperature Sensors - Optical and Acoustical Sensors - Thermo mechanical sensors and Actators.
